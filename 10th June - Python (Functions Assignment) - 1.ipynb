    "In summary, while Python's argument passing mechanism shares some characteristics with both \"pass by value\" and \"pass by reference,\" it's more accurately described as \"pass by object reference.\" Changes made to the mutable objects (e.g., lists) passed as arguments can affect the original object, but reassigning the parameter to a new object won't affect the original object outside the function. Immutable objects (e.g., integers, strings) behave similarly to \"pass by value\" in that changes within the function do not affect the original object."
